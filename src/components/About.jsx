              <p> Hello, my name is Alexjandro Mendoza and I'm currently a student pursuing a bachelors degree in Computer Science. 
              <br/>I have a passion for investing and would like to take my earnings from
               my career job to spend on rental properties. 
               <br/>I wish I had a mentor in the real estate field but 
              it seems like I will have to make mistakes on my own and network to meet people.
              <br/>I live in Yonkers and it sucks! However, I am grateful for having a roof over my head. 
              <br/> I'm into video games, food, technology, and I loved speeding on the highway 
               but these tickets are not fun so my speeding days are over. 
               <br/>Check out my highlights for some videos games in the highlights section!
